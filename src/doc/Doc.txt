Considerations:

* The "index" or "position" of each list starts at zero.

* The insertPosition(int, int) method does not insert new nodes at positions: zero and after the last position.
(Use the specific methods to insert nodes at those positions).

* The deletePosition(int) method deletes the node from any position.
(As long as the position exists in the list).
